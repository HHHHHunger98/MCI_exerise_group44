questions that I consider not worth spending time on...


- Given a picture of a bad visualization... Describe 2 problems that makes this visualization a bad one. (2 Pt)
- Given 2 visualization examples of the same data... Which visualization is better? Describe why. (2 Pt.)
- Given 3 pictures of basic diagrams... Name the basic diagram types. (3 Pt.)
- Given 3 pictures of scientific visualizations... Name the visualization methods. (3 Pt.)
- Sketch the following basic diagram types: bar chart, line chart, pie chart etc. (1 Pt. each)
- Given 4 pictures of grids... Name the given grids/meshes. (2 Pt.)
- Sketch one of the given grids: regular, irregular, unstructured, curvilinear (1 Pt.)
- Assign the matching properties to the nodes: has metric, has no metric, has
  order, has no order, discrete, continuous (5 Pt.)
- Analyze the visual variables used in visualizations (e.g. in journals). Are
  the visualizations effective? If necessary, find alternative possibilities.
- Given 2 examples of bad color maps... Why are these color maps inappropriate
  in the context of ordinal data? Shortly describe the issues. (1+1 Pt)
- Given one example of visualization utilizing bi-variate color scales...
  Describe what type of color scale was chosen. (1 Pt)
- Select a folder on your hard drive (which contains neither too many nor too
  few subfolders and files) and construct a treemap. You can also write your own
  program or follow the algorithm of an InfoVis toolkit.
- Select an application that you use often. Reflect in which way the software
  incorporates techniques such as zooming, focus+context, overview+detail. What
  additional functionalities would you find helpful?
- Given pictures of spheres with different lighting models (ambient only,
  Lambertian, Blinn, combined)... Assign the following light models to the
  pictures: No lighting, Lambertian reflectance, Specular Blinn- Phong,
  Lambertian and Blinn-Phong combined (3 Pt)
- Given pictures of slicing, projection and clipping... Assign the right
  techniques to the pictures. (2 Pt)
- Given a grid with grid size Î”x and a query point x... Determine the cell (jx
  jy) and the relative position within the cell for the query point x.**
- Given a Voronoi Diagram... Draw the corresponding Delaunay Graph for the given
  Voronoi Diagram.
- What are the typical tools of a transfer function editor? (3 Pt)
    - is this seriously a question?
- Given a table direct vs. indirect volume rendering methods... Assign the
  following techniques to either direct or indirect volume rendering: e.g.
  texture slicing, shear warp, raycasting, dual contouring, marching cubes,
  cuberille (0.5 Pt each)
- Given pictures of a simulated discrete vector field (see slide 14)... Depicted
  is the progressive flow field in successive time steps t0 . . t 3 Draw the
  following characteristic lines in the sketches below: streak line, path line,
  stream line for t 2 (3 Pt)
